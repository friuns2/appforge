To open apps using deep links such as Twitter, Spotify, and Google Maps, you can use the \`window.open\` method or \`navigator.share\`. Here are some examples:

// Example for opening Twitter
window.open('https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check%20this%20out!', '_blank');

// Example for opening Spotify
window.open('https://open.spotify.com/', '_blank');

// Example for opening Google Maps
window.open('https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=New+York', '_blank');

// Alternatively, using navigator.share for sharing links
if (navigator.share) {
    navigator.share({
        title: 'Check this out!',
        url: 'https://example.com'
    }).then(() => {
        console.log('Share successful');
    }).catch((error) => {
        console.error('Error sharing:', error);
    });
}
